# Lesson 2
1. これ　/ それ　/ あれ
-- When you want to talk about "this thing", "that one", and so forth, you can use _kore_, _sore_, and _are_
    - _kore_ means - "this one" as in a thing that is close to you.
    - _sore_ means - "that one" as in a thing that is close to the person you are talking to.
    - _are_ means - "that one" (over there) as in something that is neither close to the speaker or the listener.
    -- there is also __-dore__ for "which"
2. この / その　/ あの　/ どの
    - the -re series stand alone and are directly followed by _wa_ as they more or less translate to "this thing" or "that thing", while the _no_ series must be followed by a noun before it gets connected to _wa_.
    -- _kono_ - "this"
    -- _sono_ - "that"
    -- _ano_ - "that" (over there)

    - __Summary__, it is okay to use the __re__ series for humans if you are referring to people that have appeared in an earlier passage, or if you are just pointing at a picture of a person.
3. ここ　/ そこ　/ あそこ　/ どこ
 - ko-so-a-do set
       1. _koko_ - here, near me
       2. _soko_ - there, near you
       3. _asoko_ - over there
       4. _doko_ - where

1. だれの noun
    - __dare__ can be used to say "who", to say "whose" you add the particle _no_
2.  も　noun
    - In order to say "too", we use _mo_
    --in Japanese the _mo_ is placed directly after the item that is just like another that has been introduced earlier.
3. じゃないです noun
    - To negate a statement of the form X _wa_ Y _desu_, where Y is a noun, you replace _desu_ with _ja nai desu_
    - _Ja nai desu_ is used mostly in spoken manner and is loose. The more formal replacement is _ja arimasen_. Used formally in writing is _de wa arimasen_

    --**Desu and ja nai must always be accompanied by a noun.**
4. -ね　and -よ
    - Statements often end with tags ne or yo, depending on the way the speaker views the interaction with the listener. If you are seeking the listeners confirmation or agreement you add _-ne_.
    - If you want to tell the listener that you are fully confident of what you are saying and the listener had better believe it, use _-yo_.
## Expression notes
- _kudasai_ is "Please give me X". You can use it to request (concrete) items in general
- _onegaishimasu_ is also used to request for item X. It is slightly more upscale than _kudasai_ and can be used when ordering food or also when ordering abstract objects like repairs, explanations, understanding.
- _doozo_ is used when an offer is made with respect to item X. A restaurant attendant uses it when they are about to hand the menu to the customer.
