# Lesson 1
## _Simple verb type sentences_


A verb is an action word like "go" - all by itself it can make a sentence in Japanese. Subjects are often implied when saying things in Japanese.

- となむ
--make a request or to ask a favor, ie "I beg you"
-Non-past form verbs - name implies that it can be used in a present or future tense 
- 行く
--pronounced "iku" means will go, ie "I'll go!"
- ます is the only thing that will change these verb type sentences, it changes the politeness level
--認めます
--pronounced "Mitomemasu" means acknowledge/confirm, ie "I confirm it", in a polite sense

| plain/polite | meaning | as sentence
| ------ | ------ | ----- 
| kau/kaimasu | buy | "They buy it" or "I will buy it" 
| nomu/nomimasu | drink | "He drinks" or "Everyone will drink"
| taberu/tabemasu | eat | "We eat" or "She will eat"
| miru/mimasu | look at/watch | "She looks at [it]" or "We will watch"
| kuru/kimasu | come | "He comes" or "They will come"
| suru/shimasu | do | "They will do [it]" or "I will do [it]"

- Verb facts
--two irregular verbs in Japanese, all the rest fit into one of two groups
--_Group 1_ sometimes called -u verbs, change the final -u to an -i and add -masu
--_Group 2_ sometimes called -ru verbs, change final -ru into -masu

## Simple noun-type sentences with desu です
A noun is a person/place/or thing. Entire sentences can be made in Japanese using a noun +desu. Much is implied. The noun cannot be a sentence by itself, desu is needed. Desu may mean 
is/are.

- ムスメ　です
-- "This is my daughter" , musume means daughter/girl/maiden
- **Desu** equals the verb "to be"
--does not change form with number,person,future tense
--"ハイ　Tanner　です”　"Hello, this is Tanner"

### Plain equivalent of desu　です is da　だ

です　is polite and represents PL3 speech, its plain PL2 equivalent is だ, da can sound abrupt so some of its use is limited to male speakers
 - わあ雪だ　"Wow, it is snowing"
**da and desu differ only in politeness**

- other useful points
--desu can mean "will be" if it is implied
--can also come after a _place_ to imply that's where the subject is

## Adjective type sentences
An adjective type sentence describes something. Adjectives often have the verb portion of "to be", used in English sentences like "She *is* late", built into the adjective in Japanese, 
**making things much easier.**
- **おそい** Osoi meaning "She's late" or "You're late"


- all adjectives in Japanese end in い
--**おさむい、さむい** meaning "Oh, it's cold out there"


**The polite form of an adjective is made by adding -desu to the end.** This doesn't change the meaning or tense, only the politeness. Can add -desu for politeness




| Kana | Romaji | meaning　| sentence
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ------
| おおきい | Ookii | big | "He's huge"
| とおい | Tooi| far or distant|"Its a long way"
| ながい | Nagai | is long | "It's long
| ちいさい| Chiisai | little/small | "They're small"
| ちかい | Chikai | near/close |  "That's nearby"
| みじかい | Mijikai | short | "They're short"
| おいしい | Oishii | tasty | "It's delicious"
| おもしろい| Omoshiroi | interesting | "This is interesting"
| やすい | Yasui | inexpensive | "They're cheap"
| まずい | Mazui | bad/unsavory | "It's awful
| つまらない | Tsumaranai| boring/dull | "They're boring"
| たかい| Takai | high/expensive | "It's expensive"

# Continued from Genki Lesson 1
## Grammer
1. Remember that __-desu__ can come after a __noun__ and make a complete sentence
--if the subject is not implied you need to specify with a "topic" followed by __-wa__、***Form*** - X is Y, As for X, it is Y
--wa is a member of the group of words called "particles"
2. __Question sentences__
    - You can add __-ka__ at the end of a statement and make it a question
        - We can ask questions with _nanji_(what time), _nansai_(how old), _nannensee_(what year in school), and _nanban_(what number)
    --　せんこは　なんですか (What is your major?)
    -- いま　なんじですか (What time is it now?)
    -- Tanner　さんは　なんさいですか (Mr. Tanner, how old are you?)
    -- なんねんせいですか (What year are you in school?)
3. __Noun1 の Noun2__
    - No is a particle that connects two nouns. The second noun provides the main idea and the first one makes it more specific
-- First you have to figure out what the main idea is, that is noun 2. From there you specify using noun 1.
-- Put the sentence together using noun1 -no noun2
-- pay attention to the nouns in the sentence and make sure it is a 's relationship or a __"of"__ relationship. (Tanner's mother or student of Arkansas State University)
