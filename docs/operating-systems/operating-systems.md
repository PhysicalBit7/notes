# Operating systems
-  Fall 2022


## Introduction

An operating system (OS) is the software that manages a computerâ€™s resources for the computer's users and their applications.


An OS provides:

- Resource allocation
- Isolation
- Communication

An OS is responsible for **resource allocation**. It must allocate finite memory and processors to running applications.

An OS must provide **isolation**. A bug in one program shouldn't bring down the system, and users shouldn't be able to access or change another user's data.

Sometimes isolated programs need to communicate with each other. An OS provides mechanisms for **communication** between running programs.
