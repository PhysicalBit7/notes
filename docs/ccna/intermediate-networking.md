### VLANs
---

#### VLAN Creation

```
conf t
vlan 10
name Faculty
exit
```

```
conf t
vlan 20
name Students
exit
```

#### Port Assignment

```
conf t
interface range Fa0/1-12
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
end
```

```
conf t interface range Fa0/13-24
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20
end
```

```
conf t
interface Gi0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 99
end
```

#### IP Assignment

```
cont t
int vlan 99
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
end
```

#### Verification

```
show vlan brief
```

#### Voice and Data VLAN

*Assuming Data on VLAN 10, Voice on VLAN 20*

```
conf t
int Fa0/4
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
switchport voice vlan 20
end
```

#### Management VLAN

```
conf t
vlan 99
name Management
exit
interface Fa0/24
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 99
exit
int vlan 99
ip addr 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
end
```

#### Delete VLANS on file

```
delete vlan.dat
```

#### Delete VLANS in memory
*Warning: Make sure you move ports to another vlan or they will be unusable*

```
conf t
no vlan 10
no vlan 20
end
```

#### Inter-VLAN Routing

*Creates multiple sub-interfaces on a router port to enable inter-vlan routing.*

*Note: `encapsulation dot1q` must be called on a sub interface before an IP can be assigned to it.*

```
conf t
interface G0/0/1.10
description Default Gateway for VLAN 10
encapsulation dot1Q 10
ip add 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface G0/0/1.20
description Default Gateway for VLAN 20
encapsulation dot1Q 20
ip addr 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface G0/0/1.99
description Default Gateway for VLAN 99
encapsulation dot1Q 99
ip addr 192.168.99.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface G0/0/1
description Trunk link to S1
no shut
end
```

### Trunks
---

#### Create multi-switch vlan trunk

*S1*

```
conf t
interface Gi0/1
description Trunk Line to S2 Gi0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk native vlan 99
switchport trunk allowed vlan 99
end
```

*Note: Remember to set the native vlan (to 99 for instance) on each switch in the trunk so you don't get a native vlan mismatch warning*

#### Trunk Verification

```
show interface trunk
show interface g0/1 switchport
```

### EtherChannel
---

Etherchannel protocols LACP and PAgP configure multiple physical interfaces and links to act as one logical one. You can configure up to 8 ports to act as a single link. This increases bandwidth and improves redundancy.


*Note: `mode active` sets the etherchannel group to use the LACP protocol*

#### Configure EtherChannel

*Configure etherchannel between two switches connected with two ethernet cables.*
```
conf t
int range f0/1-2
channel-group 1 mode active
exit
int port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,2,20
```


#### Verify EtherChannel

```
show interfaces trunk
show etherchannel summary
```

### DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)
---

#### Configure DTP

```
conf t
int gi0/1
switchport mode dynamic auto
end
```

**or**

```
conf t
int gi0/1
switchport mode dynamic desirable
end
```


#### Disable DTP

*Useful for connecting to devices that don't support Cisco proprietary DTP or creating a static trunk*

```
conf t
int gi0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport nonegotiate
end
```

#### Verify DTP

```
show dtp interface gi0/1
```
