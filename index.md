        <h4><b>About Me</b></h4>
        <p>Hello, my name is Tanner Patrom, I am currently a computer science graduate student at <a href="https://www.astate.edu/">Arkansas State University</a> where I also have worked full time as a Network Technician for 3 years.</p>
        <p>This website will eventually serve as my portfolio, but currently is geared toward being a collection of notes from my studies at school and other hobbies. It has been a goal of mine to centralize all of my university/work notes, as well as other resources I may have used along the way, and publish them online for use in my life and possibly others.</p>
